<p style="text-align: center; font-family: Caslon; font-size: large;"><u>A Name That Resonates In Every Household</u>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 50px;margin-right: 50px; font-size:medium;">From a 150 sq.ft store in Pune to being one of Puneâ€™s
    leading Jewellery brands with over 12 sprawling stores all over the city, Abhi Jewellers has left behind a golden
    trail.
    Our journey that began in 1879 was later re-established by Sunil Baviskar with a vision to give people authentic
    jewellery that is not just elegant, but in fact a class apart, along with uncompromising quality and delicate
    craftsmanship.
    Over 143 years into the business, we have succeeded in overcoming various obstacles and our presence in the Indian
    market has been marked by a number of firsts. We have expanded our variety from just gold and silver to even
    platinum and diamonds. Over the years, we have earned a distinct and dependable name and have emerged as the
    Pioneers in the jewellery business in the Western Maharashtrian market.</p><br>

        <p style="margin-left: 50px;">
            Our burning passion and desire to create something innovative has led us to venture into other spectrums and
            craft luxurious items that have been path breaking in the line of the jewellery business. We have been able
            to carve a niche in combining old world concepts and inculcating contemporary patterns in them. We offer an
            entire range of jewellery in gold, diamond, platinum and precious stones.
